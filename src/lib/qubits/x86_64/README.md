# Assembly implementations of gates

This folder contains implementations of some of the gates for the x86_64 architecture. 

## Notes

Maybe it would be good to give hte asm files the same name as the c++ implementation files that implement the same functions. If they were put in separate folders, the makefile could compile a particular implementation by building from the required folder (x86_64 or cpp, for example).
