#+TITLE: Planning for Version 1

* Steps (overview)
1. [ ] Plan features and interface
   - Write down overall library purpose
   - What gates to support?
   - Support for omp, sse, avx, gpu, etc?
   - Types of simulators? (np, resize, normal, etc?)
   - Interface requirements (gate names, how to choose simulator, etc.)
   - Any additional utilities? (fidelity, distance, etc?)
2. [ ] Plan seeding/reproducibility
3. [ ] Plan how to test each feature
   - [ ] How to cover simulator variants without repetition?
   - [ ] Any need for mocks?
   - [ ] Plan for checking random elements based on seeds
4. [ ] Plan how to check performance of each feature
5. [ ] Sketch-plan eventual build system, and set up development build system. 
6. [ ] Implement basic state vector functions for each simulator type
   - [ ] State vector initialisation and manipulation
   - [ ] Test basic state vector functions
   - [ ] Perform performance test
   - [ ] Document functions
7. [ ] Implement one-qubit and two-qubit gates for each simulator type
   - [ ] Test
   - [ ] Perform performance test
   - [ ] Document functions
8. [ ] Measurement, postselection, sampling for each simulator type
   - [ ] Test 
   - [ ] Perform performance test
   - [ ] Document functions
9. [ ] Implement and test each simulator variant (omp, sse, etc.)
   - [ ] Omp
   - [ ] Others here...
   - [ ] Test simulator variants
   - [ ] Document new simulator variants
10. Finalise the library ready for release
    - [ ] Find any major design flaws and re-implement if necessary
    - [ ] Test use cases (e.g. test in mbqcsim).
11. [ ] Get a release ready
    - [ ] Develop a "production" build system
    - [ ] Document build and install process
    - [ ] Set up CI for the release (for fixing issues)
    - [ ] Release library!
